Hi there! I'm a first-year Electrical and Computer Engineering Ph.D student at Duke University, working in the <a href='https://pearsonlab.github.io'>Brain and Computation lab</a>, advised by Prof. John Pearson. 
With my interests in Computational Maths and Computer Science, I'm always thrilled to build computational tools to help people solve problems. Before Duke, I worked as a data science Research Assistant in <a href='http://www.kwoklab.org'>Kwok Lab</a> and help conducted research in recognition memory and episodic memory. My undergraduate research focused on machine learning applications in bioinformatics reresearch. 

I'm working on finding the projects for my PhD study, but my current research interests can be concluded as: 

1. Computational Neuroscience and Statistical Machine Learning
2. Real-time Algorthitm for Neural Data
3. Research Software Development
