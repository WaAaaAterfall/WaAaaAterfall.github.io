Hi there, I'm a first-year Electrical and Computer Engineering Ph.D student at Duke University, working in the <a href='https://pearsonlab.github.io'>Brain and Computation lab</a>, advised by Prof. John Pearson. Before Duke, I worked as a data science Research Assistant in <a href='http://www.kwoklab.org'>Kwok Lab</a> and help conducted research in recognition memory and episodic memory. My undergraduate research focused on machine learning applications in bioinformatics reresearch. 

With my passions in Computational Maths and Computer Science, I'm always excited to create computational tools that make solving problems easier for people.

As I begin my PhD journey, my current research interests are: 

1. Computational Neuroscience and Statistical Machine Learning
2. Real-time Algorthitm for Neural Data
3. Research Software Development
