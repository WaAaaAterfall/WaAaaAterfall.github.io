With the advent of large-scale neuronal recordings in neuroscience, researchers have revealed spatiotemporal correlations in neuronal activity. These discoveries suggest an underlying lower-dimensional brain structure that can be uncovered from high-dimensional neural data. This theory parallels the manifold hypothesis in machine learning, which posits that high-dimensional data often lie on a lower-dimensional manifold. This brings us to a problem in computational neuroscience: How can dimensionality reduction be applied to compress neural data in ways that enhance our understanding of brain function?

To address the challenge of discovering low-dimensional patterns in large-scale neural data, the Pearson lab has previously developed SPLAT (Sparse Pattern Learning Across Time), a model designed to uncover neural ensemble patterns from spike counts recordings. Building on this work, I am extending this model to handle calcium imaging dataâ€” an increasingly popular method for monitoring neural population activity at scale. This extension allows SPLAT to analyze new types of data while preserving its strengths in dimensionality reduction.

Glow-SPLAT, named for the fluorescence of calcium signals captured under the microscope, extends SPLAT to handle continuous calcium imaging data. This statistical generative model leverages an Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework for efficient learning. It incorporates particle filtering (sequential Monte Carlo) in the E-step and gradient descent in the M-step. Implemented in JAX, Glow-SPLAT takes full advantage of GPU acceleration, which is critical for rapidly fitting the model to large-scale neural data.

One of the key features of both SPLAT and Glow-SPLAT is their ability to operate in a streaming framework. This makes the models particularly well-suited for adaptive experiments, where experimental parameters can be adjusted dynamically based on incoming data. At present, Glow-SPLAT can analyze data from thousands of neurons faster than the rate of data acquisition, offering new possibilities for interpreting neural activity patterns in real-time and guiding future neuroscience research.
